# Memory Game - React Example

This is a example of memory game build with React. Project structure is based from course ["Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6/table-of-contents). Idea for styling found on ["How to Build a Memory Matching Game in JavaScript"](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript).

## Get Started

1. **Install [Node 6 or newer](https://nodejs.org)**. Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
2. **Clone this repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/sjakovic/memory-game-react.git` or [download the zip](https://github.com/sjakovic/memory-game-react.git/archive/master.zip)
3. **Make sure you're in the directory you just created.** - `cd memory-game-react`
4. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`
5. **Run the app.** - `npm start -s`
   This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching files all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
7. **For production build run.** - `npm run build`
